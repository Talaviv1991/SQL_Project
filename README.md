PUBLISHARE SQL Project:

The upcoming project is based on the PUBLISHARE database, which is an online platform that stores various articles in technological fields. 
PUBLISHARE's business model is based on referrals/advertising for various products embedded within each of the articles.

The database is designed to store information about articles, authors, categories, products, and traffic:
* Authors table stores information about the authors of the articles, including their author ID, name, and email address.
* Articles table stores information about the articles, including their article ID, title, publication date, author ID, category ID, and product ID.
* Article Types Table: A comprehensive overview of various article categories.
* Categories table stores information about the categories of the articles, including their category ID and name.
* Products table stores information about the products that are advertised in the articles, including their product ID, name, and description.
* Traffic table stores information about the traffic to the articles, including the article ID, product ID, date, number of views, and number of clicks.
